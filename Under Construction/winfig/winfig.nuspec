    <description>WinFIG is a vector graphics editor application. The file format and rendering are as close to Xfig as possible, but the program takes advantage of Windows features like clipboard, printer preview, multiple documents etc.
    
### Features include:
* Compose drawings using ellipses, circles, polygons, splines, arcs, arrows, images, text objects
* Draw solid, dashed or dotted lines with miter, round or beveled joins
* Use colors and patterns
* Manipulate your drawings by moving, stretching, flipping, aligning
* Create compound objects
* Arrange objects in different layers to control the order in which they overlap
* Use grid and magnet and constraints for geometry (e.g. to create LaTeX compatible lines only)
* Scripting interface for JavaScript
* Export to box, CGM, EMF, epic, ge, GIF, IBMGL, dxf, JPEG, LaTeX, map, MetaFont, MetaPost, PCX, PDF, pic, pictex, PNG, (Encapsulated)PostScript, ppm, pstex, PSTricks, shape, sld, SVG, tk and others
* Smart links to support diagram techniques, i.e. for creating connections between nodes.

### Registration
WinFIG is shareware and requires registration. Without a keyfile WinFIG only saves a maximum of 15 objects per figure. The registration fee is EUR 25,00 or USD 35.00.
