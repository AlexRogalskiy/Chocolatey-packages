    <summary>A general-purpose blocker for Mozilla-based browsers that happens to block ads</summary>
    <description>uBlock Origin (or uBlock&#8320;) is not an ad blocker; it's a general-purpose blocker. uBlock&#8320; blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). uBlock&#8320; [extends](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters. Furthermore, advanced mode allows uBlock&#8320; to work in [default-deny mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-default-deny), which mode will cause [all 3rd-party network requests](https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/#what-are-cross-site-requests) to be blocked by default, unless allowed by the user.
    
EasyList, Peter Lowe's Adservers, EasyPrivacy and Malware domains are enabled by default. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers, analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.
    
### Supported Browsers
Currently, this package installs the latest uBlock Origin for the following Mozilla-based browsers:

* Firefox
* Pale Moon
* Cyberfox

If none of those browsers are present, the installer will halt.

## Important Subtleties
Chocolatey is a *machine* package manager, but browser add-ons are profile-based.  The intersection creates some compromises.  

#### Installing
By default, this package installs uBlock Origin as a *default* plugin.  This means uBlock&#8320; will be an installed and enabled add-on for *new profiles only* and *does not affect existing browser profiles*.  Each new user will have the ability to disable or remove uBlock&#8320; for their profile without affecting the Chocolatey install.

#### Uninstalling
Removing a default install will *NOT remove uBlock Origin from browser profiles* that have it, but it will prevent future, new, browser profiles from getting it when they are created.  

### Options
The following package parameters can be set:

* `/AllUsers`

    uBlock Origin will be additionally be available to users who already have a browser profile.  Without the /`AutoEnable` parameter, uBlock Origin will be disabled, and users will have the option to enable/disable but not remove the add-on.  Uninstalling the package that was installed with this switch will remove uBlock Origin for all users.

* `/AutoEnable`

    ublock Origin will be enabled for all users.  This only works in conjunction with the `/AllUsers` parameter, and will modify/create a couple settings files for the browser(s) if needed.  Uninstalling this package should remove the settings.
    
* `/NoFirefox` -- Don't install for Firefox.
    
* `/NoPaleMoon` -- Don't install for Pale Moon.
    
* `/NoCyberfox` -- Don't install for Cyberfox.
    
These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
For example: 
  `-params '"/AllUsers /NoCyberfox`"'`
