Note the URLs for the latest version are always the same.  Previous versions
can be found in the archives by date, not version:
   https://marcedit.reeset.net/software/marcedit7/archive/

However, the dates on the folders correspond to the release date of the 
*next* version.  Thus, the folders contain the version released *before*
the date.  The dates of releases can be seen here:
