    <summary>Your complete, free, MARC editing utility</summary>
    <description>MarcEdit is one of the more complete metadata edit suites available to librarians and is primarily used to create and manipulate MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging) records. 

MarcEdit edits more than simply MARC records and includes a very rich feature set targeted at making metadata translation and editing easier for both the beginner and advanced users.

* **MARC Editing**:  MarcEdit includes a MARC Breaker and Maker to move MARC data into a more friendly mnemonic file format.  
* **MarcEditor**:  The MarcEditor is MarcEdit’s built in metadata editor.  It includes a number of global editing functions, full regular expression and UTF-8 support, the ability to edit MODS and MARCXML data (in a mnemonic format), as well as the ability to configure the editor to _utilize any characterset_ supported by the operating system.  
* **Clustering**: MarcEdit supports the ability to cluster on fields or subfields and edit data in clusters.
* **RDA Helper**:  The RDA Helper is both a stand alone and integrated tool that allows users to take a set of MARC data and automatically generate RDA specific data.  The RDA data is derived from the source recordset using available control data, variable field data, and RDA specific assumptions.
* **Delimited Text Translator**:  The Delimited Text Translator is a tool that allows users to translate data in Excel, Access, or any delimited format into MARC.
* **Export as Tab Delimited**:  A tool that allows users to export their MARC data as delimited text.
* **Harvest OAI Data**:  MarcEdit has the ability to harvest metadata from an OAI data provider and convert the data directly to MARC.  Supported formats are MARCXML, oaimarc, oai_dc, and MODS, but any format can be accommodated as the user is allowed to provide their own translation rules.
* **XML Translations**:  MarcEdit supports the facilitation of metadata from XML and non-XML formats into various forms, including MARC.
* **Z39.50/SRU Client**:  MarcEdit includes a built in Z39.50 and SRU client for interaction with other library systems.
* **ILS and OCLC Integrations**: The tool provides ways to integrate directly with a number of ILS providers, as well as OCLC.
* **MARC SQL Explorer**:  MarcEdit includes an SQL Explorer — a tool that allows users to export their data into either an SQLite or MySQL data and run SQL queries directly on the data to mine for information.
* **MARCValidator**:  MarcEdit includes a number of tools to help users validate data and identify incorrectly structured MARC record data.
* **Many more features**:  Like the ability to split, join, sort, etc. data in various formats.
