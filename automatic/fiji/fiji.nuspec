    <summary>A "batteries-included" distribution of ImageJ.</summary>
    <description>Fiji is a "batteries-included" distribution of ImageJ.  In other words, it is an open source image processing program for multidimensional image data with a focus on scientific imaging and bundling a lot of plugins which facilitate scientific image analysis. 

##### What does ImageJ provide?

|  |  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| [Application](https://imagej.net/Application) | A user interface with functions to load, display, and save images |
| [Techniques](https://imagej.net/Techniques) | [Image processing](https://imagej.net/docs/guide/146-29.html#toc-Section-29), [Colocalization](https://imagej.net/Colocalization), [deconvolution](https://imagej.net/Deconvolution), [registration](https://imagej.net/Registration), [segmentation](https://imagej.net/Segmentation), [tracking](https://imagej.net/Tracking), [visualization](https://imagej.net/Visualization) and much more. |
| [Plugins](https://imagej.net/Plugins) | A powerful mechanism for extending ImageJ in all kinds of useful ways. |
| [Scripting](https://imagej.net/Scripting "Scripting")  | Automated, reproducible workflows via [scripts](https://imagej.net/Scripting) and [macros](https://imagej.net/Macros), including [headless on a remote server or cluster](https://imagej.net/Scripting_Headless). |
| [Forum](http://forum.imagej.net/) | A vibrant, diverse, and helpful user [community](https://imagej.net/Community) that gives rise to insightful scientific exchanges. |

ImageJ's [extensibility](https://imagej.net/Extensibility is the root of its effectiveness: many advanced image-processing methods are not provided by the core application, but rather are [plugins](https://imagej.net/Plugins) written by specialists in specific fields, made available via [update sites](https://imagej.net/Update_sites).

#### Note
Fiji (and ImageJ) has frequent updates and is designed as a per-user install.  As Chocolatey does not handle packages per user and it is a security risk for all users to have modify rights to an application directory, this package attempts to set up Fiji as a machine-install in in a location that requires elevation to modify (i.e. update).  To resolve the issue of requiring Fiji to be run as administrator, this package will also create a weekly scheduled task to run elevated and in the background instructing Fiji to check for updates with its internal update process.
