End-user license agreement: for the Quoll Writer software written by Gary Bentley

You may install/use Quoll Writer on any machine you have access to.

No Warranties

I'm sorry but I cannot provide any warranty for the use of Quoll Writer. 
It is (and any related documentation) provided "as is" without warranty 
of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, 
the implied warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular 
purpose or noninfringement.
My apologies for the legalese but it is important, I have to cover myself 
and I cannot be held responsible for you using Quoll Writer. I have done 
my best to ensure that it is bug free and works as intended and will not 
corrupt your work but I cannot and will not guarantee it. You use Quoll 
Writer at your own risk and I recommend that you create a test project to 
try it out first to ensure that you are happy that it fits your needs. 
That said, if you are having problems with one of your projects within 
Quoll Writer then contact me as soon as possible and I will do my best to 
help resolve the issue.  

Please back up your work

By using Quoll Writer you are agreeing that you will keep adequate backups 
of your work (produced via Quoll Writer) and that the backups will be kept 
in a secure location that is suitable for storage of digital information. 
Again, I cannot be held responsible if you lose your work, backups are a 
necessary evil that helps to ensure that your time and effort are not 
wasted. Please do not use Quoll Writer if you ARE NOT doing regular 
backups. Please do not keep just a single copy of your work on disk, if you 
have a power cut and the Quoll Writer project database becomes corrupted 
then it may not be possible to retrieve it.

PLEASE DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!

I also recommend that you use a secure online backup service to ensure 
redundancy. Personally I use http://www.mozy.com, they’re cheap, reliable 
and it just works but there are many others.

If you like Quoll Writer then tell other writers

If you like Quoll Writer and it fits your needs then I would ask that you 
tell other writers you know about it. If you do not like Quoll Writer then 
I would ask that you are fair in your criticisms when you complain to 
others about it.

Let me know about bugs and your desire for new features

I am constantly looking to improve upon Quoll Writer, I wrote it because I 
like to write and I am interested in the opinions of other writers about 
what they would like to see in a writing application. I am also interested 
in ensuring that it is bug free and I would ask that you report any issues 
you have, and when you do so, please provide as much information as you can 
including screenshots where appropriate. The more information I have, the 
easier bugs are to fix.

Do not lose your encryption password(s)

If you elect to encrypt your project(s) then please DO NOT lose your 
password. It is not stored ANYWHERE and so if you lose it/forget it then 
you WILL NOT be able to access your project (regardless of whether you 
have backups) either via Quoll Writer or by using a db access mechanism 
such as the H2 console. The encryption used 
(see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard ) is very 
strong and unless you are the NSA it won't be broken, so do not lose your 
password or you will lose your work.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
