    Michael,

    I am specifically including your full name, Michael Vinther, to try to squeeze
    past spam filtering.

    Hi. I am interested in making a Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org) package for
    Image Analyzer, and I am wondering if you would be willing to give your consent
    to distribute the unaltered installation executable within the Chocolatey
    package on the public repository.

    Many Chocolatey packages download a software installer from the download
    source,
    but FossHub (your download host) has asked that Chocolatey not download from
    their site.  If the software license allows or there is express consent,
    Chocolatey packages can have the binaries "embedded" as a alternative method of
    distribution and installation.

    Thanks,
    Erich Hammer
