    <description>Chromas is a free trace viewer for simple DNA sequencing projects which do not require assembly of multiple sequences. 

![Chromas](https://technelysium.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/Chromas.png)  

#### Features:

* Opens .ab1 chromatogram files from Applied Biosystems DNA sequencers.
* Opens SCF and ZTR format chromatogram files created by other sequencers or retrieved from databases.
* Save in .scf or Applied Biosystems .ab1 format.
* Print a chromatogram with options to zoom or fit to one page.
* Automatic removal of low-quality sequence (when quality data is available) or vector sequences.
* Export sequences in plain text, FASTA, FASTQ, EMBL, GenBank or GCG formats, or formatted with base numbering for presentation.
* Copy the sequence to the clipboard in plain text, FASTA or FASTQ format for pasting into other applications.
* Reverse and complement the sequence and chromatogram.
* Search for subsequences by exact matching or optimal alignment.
* Display translations in 3 frames along with the sequence.
* Copy an image of a chromatogram section for pasting into documents or presentations.
* Batch processing, including format conversion, sequence export with vector removal, batch printing and batch export of raw data.
* Enhance .ab1 files using the PeakTrace RP component from Nucleics Pty Ltd to improve peak readability and extract more high-quality bases.

Chromas is free of charge. The *PeakTrace RP* component requires registration for a free account, and is a paid service after the 40 free units have been used. An introductory discount is available by following the [link under the Options menu](https://www.nucleics.com/buy-peaktrace-for-chromas/) in Chromas.
