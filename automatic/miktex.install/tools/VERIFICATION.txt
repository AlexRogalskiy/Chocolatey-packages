VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The embedded MiKTeX setup utility (which does NOT contain all the 
sub-packages that make up a MiKTeX installation) is available here:
   https://miktex.org/download
With the "All Downloads" tab displayed, expand the 32-bit and/or 64-bit
"MiKTeX Setup Utility" sections.  There you can see the SHA-256 hash,
and get the file via the "Download" button.

Note that the version of the Chocolatey package identifies the MiKTeX 
"milestone", not the version of the setup utility embedded in the package.
They are not always the same version.
