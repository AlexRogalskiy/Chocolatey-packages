    <summary>An Explorer extension to calculate file checksums for many hash algorithms.</summary>
    <description>HashTab provides OS extensions to calculate file hashes.
    
To use, just right-click on any file and select `Properties`. The new tab called “File Hashes” is Hashtab! 
    
#### Features
* Calculate and display hash values from over two dozen popular hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA1, SHA2, RipeMD, HAVAL and Whirlpool.  Now, SHA3 too!
* The hash comparison tool supports drag and drop, copy and paste and even has a built-in browse option. 
* Translated into 27 languages and counting, Hashtab has been downloaded millions of times from over 200 different countries.
* The perfect way to validate the integrity of a file download. Or use it to quickly compare local files and compute hashes for use in other programs.
* Purposely designed to feel like a native feature of Windows. Simply select any file, go to properties, and use the new “File Hashes” tab. 
* Save hashes to checksum files
