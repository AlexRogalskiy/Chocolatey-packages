    <summary>Complete support for the International Phonetic Alphabet</summary>
    <description>Charis SIL is a Unicode-based font family that supports the wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It is specially designed to make long texts pleasant and easy to read, even in less than ideal reproduction and display environments.

#### Highly legible design
The design of Charis SIL is optimized for high readability at low resolutions, but is also clean and clear on the latest high-resolution devices. It is an ideal choice for new readers moving on from simple sans-serif forms.Read more about its [design](http://software.sil.org/charis/design/).

#### Ideal for publishing
This family of fonts is suitable for a wide range of publishing needs, from print to web to mobile. It supports advanced OpenType and Graphite typographic features useful for multilingual texts, including careful diacritic positioning and small caps. 

#### Complete character set
The Latin and Cyrillic scripts are used to write thousands of languages around the world. Charis SIL provides comprehensive support for these writing systems, and includes a wide range of additional characters and symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work.
