    <description>Whitebox GAT is an _[open-access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access)_, well documented, and extendable software for geomatics with its roots originating from Terrain Analysis System (TAS).  It as a desktop GIS and remote sensing software package for general applications of geospatial analysis and data visualization. Whitebox GAT is intended to provide a platform for advanced geospatial data analysis with applications in both environmental research and the geomatics industry more broadly. It was envisioned from the outset as providing an ideal platform for experimenting with novel geospatial analysis methods. Equally important is the project’s goal of providing a tool that can be used for geomatics-based education. 
    
    Open-access software can be viewed as a complimentary extension to the traditional open-source software (OSS) model of development. Open-access software is distinct from other OSS in that it has an explicitly stated design goal of reducing barriers to the transfer of knowledge to the user community. Direct insight into the workings of algorithm design and implementation allows for educational opportunities and increases the potential for rapid innovation, experimentation with algorithms, and community-directed development. This is particularly important in geomatics because many geospatial algorithms are complex and are strongly affected by implementation details. Also, there are often multiple competing algorithms for accomplishing the same task and the choice of one method over another can greatly impact the outcome of a workflow.
