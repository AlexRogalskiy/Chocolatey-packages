    <summary>Crystal Structure Visualisation, Exploration and Analysis Made Easy</summary>
    <description>Mercury offers a comprehensive range of tools for 3D structure visualization and the exploration of crystal packing. With a long pedigree and over 10,000 downloads, Mercury is firmly established as the visualiser of choice within the crystallographic community.

With a vast number of options for customizing display settings Mercury is widely used for the generation of publication-quality images. A Style Manager contains a number of pre-defined display styles for work, publication and presentation and also provides the ability to preserve and share your own custom display settings. Stunning 3D images created using Mercury can be exported in a variety of common formats. In addition, it is possible to render high quality ray-traced images using POV-Ray.

Mercury is able to load structural data from a variety of formats and provides an extensive array of options to aid the investigation and analysis of crystal structures. Generate packing diagrams of any number of unit cells in any direction, define and visualise least-squares and Miller planes, and take a slice through a crystal in any direction. Simulated diffraction patterns can be calculated for any displayed crystal structure. Bravais, Friedel, Donnay and Harker (BFDH) theoretical crystal morphologies can also be viewed.

A unique and key feature of Mercury is the ability to locate and display hydrogen bonds, short non-bonded contacts, and user-specified types of contacts e.g. chlorine...oxygen contacts in the range 2-4Å. By building and exploring networks of intermolecular contacts you will gain an understanding of the key interactions that drive crystal packing.

Mercury is available as a free download. The version of Mercury provided to CSD System subscribers contains some extra functionality, only available to those with a CSD System licence. If your institution has one of these, you may obtain this functionality by registration

### License Agreement

_In order to download this version of Mercury, you must first read and accept the [terms of the licence agreement](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/solutions/csd-system/components/mercury/licence/)._

**IMPORTANT:** Mercury and EnCIFer now require activation in order to be used. This can be performed for free using the included CCDC Activator tool and selecting the CSD-Community option. You can also activate with a CSD System licence if you have one.

### Included software

The latest version of Mercury is only distributed with [EnCIFer 1.5.2](http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/Community/csd-community/encifer/) incorperated, and the installer drops icons for both on the desktop.  Version 1.5.2 of EnCIFer is not downloadable, installable nor uninstallable on its own.  The stand-alone, previous version of enCIFer is here](https://chocolatey.org/packages/encifer)
