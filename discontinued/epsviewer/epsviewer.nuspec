### What is a PS file?
The .ps file extension, associated with Adobe PostScript, is known in electronic and desktop publishing areas as a page description language file. Image saved in PostScript, may contain vector graphics, raster graphics or text and **can be printed directly by a PostScript printer without being opened in an application**.  Adobe PostScript 3 is a worldwide printing and imaging standard and is used by print service providers, publishers, corporations, and government agencies. PostScript enables reliable printing of visually rich documents although .ps files have largely been replaced by other page layout formats, such as PDF. 

### What is an EPS file?
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file format is used in vector based images in Adobe Illustrator.  EPS files can contain text and graphics and also include preview image in bitmap format.  There are two types of EPS file. One type is a vector based graphics file that can be opened and easily edited in any vector based programs.  EPS Viewer supports resizing these EPS files as they contains instructions for creating lines, points, areas and colors. This means EPS images can be resized without losing any quality.  The second type of EPS file is the flattened, set-resolution "photo" type file that can be opened in Photoshop or other programs for image editing.  EPS Viewer supports both types of EPS file and can convert EPS files to other photo formats.
