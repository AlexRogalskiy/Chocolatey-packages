LICENSE

Unless clearly stated otherwise, all WhitSoft programs are freeware, and 
as such are freely distributable. The one condition is that the program 
file itself must not be modified from its original form; however, it may 
be packaged or bundled with other software. If you are distributing a 
WhitSoft program, I'd appreciate a short email and a copy of the 
distributed package if possible.
