MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT EXPRESSION WEB 4  AND EXPRESSION DESIGN 4
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or 
based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read 
them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media 
on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

  * updates,
  * supplements,
  * Internet-based services, and
  * support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, 
those terms apply.

By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept 
them, do not use the software.

As described below, using some features also operates as your consent 
to the transmission of certain standard computer information for 
Internet-based services.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. You may install and use any number of 
  copies of the software on your devices to design, develop and test 
  your programs.
2. THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS AND NOTICES.  The software includes third party 
  code.  The third party code included in the software is licensed to 
  you by Microsoft under this license agreement, rather than licensed 
  to you by any third party under some other license terms.  Notices, 
  if any, for this third party code are included with the software and 
  may also be found in the ThirdPartyNotices.txt file.
3. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services 
  with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

  a.  Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software feature described 
    below connects to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over 
    the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice 
    when they connect. You may switch off this feature or not use it. 
    For more information about this feature, see the software documentation. 
    By using this feature, you consent to the transmission of this 
    information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or 
    contact you.
    
    i.  Computer Information. The following feature uses Internet 
      protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer 
      information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of 
      operating system, browser and name and version of the software 
      you are using, and the language code of the device where you 
      installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make 
      the Internet-based service available to you.
        
      SuperPreview Online Service.  The Expression Web software contains 
      an online service feature that allows you to use certain browsers 
      to preview existing web pages;  to view your newly created webpages; 
      or, view webpages  on your local intranet.  When the SuperPreview 
      client application starts it will always attempt to contact the 
      SuperPreview online service through a process called “Discovery”.  
      If the SuperPreview client is signed up with the online service, 
      discovery will return both the list of available remote browsers 
      with icons and a list of disabled browser versions that are known 
      to not work with SuperPreview.  Discovery will return results 
      depending on the configuration of the SuperPreview client.  Once 
      discovery returns information to the SuperPreview client, the 
      user-interface of the SuperPreview client may be updated if changes 
      occurred.  A modal dialog will appear, notifying you of what 
      changes took place; whether a browser was added, removed, or 
      updated.   For web pages on your local machine, and for sites 
      identified as being part of an intranet, the SuperPreview client 
      creates a zip package of the web page you are attempting to 
      preview, including all assets associated with that page (CSS files, 
      images, JavaScript code, etc).  The SuperPreview client then 
      transmits this package to the online service.  The online service 
      then extracts the package to temporary space and previews the page 
      with the remote browsers selected by the SuperPreview client.  
      After previewing is complete the package is deleted from the 
      temporary space.  The online service will then return to the 
      SuperPreview client an image render and positioning data as 
      described above. 

    ii.  Use of Information. We may use the computer information, and 
      search suggestion information, to improve our software and services. 
      We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software 
      vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products 
      run with Microsoft software.

    Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement 
    and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
    laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all 
    other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, 
    unfair competition laws, and in tort.

    other country, the laws of that country apply.
    
10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may 
  have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have 
  rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. 
  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your 
  country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear 
  the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees 
  or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your 
  local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted 
  under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of 
  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover 
  from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.

  This limitation applies to

    * anything related to the software, services, content (including 
      code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
    * claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or 
      condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the 
      extent permitted by applicable law.

  It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the 
  possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not 
  apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or 
  limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
