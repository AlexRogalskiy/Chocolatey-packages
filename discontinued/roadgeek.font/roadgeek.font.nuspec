    <summary>Closely aproximated typefaces used on highway signs in various countries</summary>
    <description>Roadgeek 2005 includes:
    
* The 7, FHWA font series (aka Highway Gothic) - used in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Taiwan:  B, C, D, E, EM (E modified), EEM (Enhanced E modified), F. EM is E but with looser spacing and thicker strokes to accommodate reflective buttons; because the buttons are no longer widely used EEM undoes the thicker strokes but keeps the looser spacing.
* Clearview - used in some parts of the United States and Indonesia, designed as a replacement of the FHWA Series typefaces. Available in 13 series: 1B through 6B for negative contrast (dark on light) signs, 1W through 6W and 5WR for positive contrast (light on dark) signs. 5WR is just 5W with tighter spacing.
* DIN 1451 - German sign typeface. Available in 2 series: Engschrift and Mittelschrift
* Transport - UK sign typeface. Available in 2 weights: Medium for positive contrast signs and Heavy for negative contrast signs
* Motorway - UK sign typeface, but only for route numbers on motorway signs. Available in 2 weights: Permanent for positive contrast signs and Temporary for negative contrast signs.
* Clarendon - used by the US National Park Service ("Old Parks")
* Rawlinson - a replacement for Clarendon ("New Parks")
* Arrows, icons, and signbacks
