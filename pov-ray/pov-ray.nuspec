	<description>The Persistence of Vision Ray-Tracer creates three-dimensional, photo-realistic images using a rendering technique called ray-tracing. It reads in a text file containing information describing the objects and lighting in a scene and generates an image of that scene from the view point of a camera also described in the text file. Ray-tracing is not a fast process by any means, but it produces very high quality images with realistic reflections, shading, perspective and other effects.
    
### Licensing
This installs both the [AGPL3-licensed](http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html) application and the editor DLLs which implement the optional codemax code editor not covered by the AGPL3.  The DLLs are provided pursuant to the license that applied to the previous version of POV-Ray (v3.62) and may only be used under [those terms](http://www.povray.org/povlegal-3.6.html).

### Note
POV-ray installs the application for all users (in \Program Files\), but installs libraries, samples and *necessary* settings files into ONLY the current user's \Documents\ directory.  By default, other users will get indeciferable error messages when first starting POV-ray.  This Chocolatey package mitigates that problem somewhat by copying the files to the default user profile.  It does not resolve the issue with respect to existing user profiles, but it will also copy the default files to the POV-ray install directory so they can be easily found.  [See here](http://news.povray.org/povray.windows/thread/%3Cweb.54f86f031557c88775fef6f50%40news.povray.org%3E/) [and here](http://news.povray.org/povray.windows/thread/%3Cweb.4dc4274092d8768d9b17e07a0%40news.povray.org%3E) for details.
