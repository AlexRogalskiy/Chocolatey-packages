    <summary>A general-purpose blocker for Mozilla-based browsers that happens to block ads</summary>
    <description>uBlock Origin (or uBlock&#8320;) is not an ad blocker; it's a general-purpose blocker. uBlock&#8320; blocks ads through its support of the [Adblock Plus filter syntax](https://adblockplus.org/en/filters). uBlock&#8320; [extends](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-syntax-extensions) the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters. Furthermore, advanced mode allows uBlock&#8320; to work in [default-deny mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-default-deny), which mode will cause [all 3rd-party network requests](https://requestpolicycontinued.github.io/#what-are-cross-site-requests) to be blocked by default, unless allowed by the user.
    
EasyList, Peter Lowe's Adservers, EasyPrivacy and Malware domains are enabled by default. Many more lists are readily available to block trackers, analytics, and more. Hosts files are also supported.
    
### Supported Browsers
Currently, this package installs the latest uBlock Origin for the following Mozilla-based browsers:

* Firefox
* Pale Moon
* Cyberfox

If none of those browsers are present, the installer will halt.

### Note
This package installs uBlock Origin as a default plugin.  This means when a user first starts a supported browser, uBlock Origin will be an installed and enabled add-on for the user.  Each user has the ability to disable or remove uBlock Origin for their profile.  The default install does not affect users who already have a browser profile.

### Options
The following package parameters can be set:

* `/AllUsers`

    uBlock Origin will be additionally be available to users who already have a browser profile.  Without the /`AutoEnable` parameter, uBlock Origin will be disabled at first.  Users will have the option to enable/disable but cannot remove the add-on.

* `/AutoEnable`

    ublock Origin will be enabled for all users.  This only works in conjunction with the `/AllUsers` parameter, and will modify/create a couple settings files for the browser(s) if needed.  Uninstalling this package should remove the settings.
    
* `/NoFirefox`

    Don't install for Firefox.
    
* `/NoPaleMoon`

    Don't install for Pale Moon.
    
* `/NoCyberfox`

    Don't install for Cyberfox.
    
These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
For example: 
  `-params '"/AllUsers /NoCyberfox`"'`
