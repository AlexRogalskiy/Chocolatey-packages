    <summary>Comprehensive spectroscopy software</summary>
    <description>Bio-Rad’s award-winning KnowItAll software offers comprehensive solutions for spectral analysis, identification, search, data management, and reporting. It supports multiple instrument vendor file formats and techniques (IR, Raman, NIR, NMR, MS, UV-Vis). The software, combined with over 2.3 million spectra, helps chemists extract even greater knowledge from their spectral data.

    Researchers use spectral search software along with spectral databases to identify unknown substances and verify the composition of synthesized materials in a number of applications and industries. First, precision instruments measure a substance and produce a spectrum, which is expressed as a graph showing a series of peaks that is specific to the sample material. That spectrum is then compared to a reference database of the measured spectra of known substances. If a matching spectrum is found, the material in question can be identified. Bio-Rad’s KnowItAll solutions provide search software tools, as well as the world's most extensive collection of reference spectra used in this type of analysis.
