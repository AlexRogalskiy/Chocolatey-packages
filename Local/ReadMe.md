### Important Info!
The files here are sanitized versions of [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages) scripts written to assist with installing software that is not available to download for free, requires registration to download, or does not have an official license statement.  As such these packages cannot be pushed to the [Chocolatey public repository](https://chocolatey.org/packages).  

Any use of these scripts will at a minimum require modest adjustments to the contents of the files to point to a local copy of the install files in question.  In some cases, the files may require significant modifications to install the software in a customized way.
