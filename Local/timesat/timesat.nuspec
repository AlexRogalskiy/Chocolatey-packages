    <description>TIMESAT is a software package for analysing time-series of satellite sensor data. TIMESAT was developed to be able to investigate the seasonality of satellite time-series data and their relationship with dynamic properties of vegetation, such as phenology and temporal development. The temporal domain holds important information about short- and long-term vegetation changes. 
TIMESAT runs from a graphical user interface. For large images or long time-series Fortran executables ensure fast processing. Matlab is the default running environment but is no longer required.

TIMESAT is freely available for non-commercial academic research (see our Distribution policy)[http://web.nateko.lu.se/timesat/timesat.asp?cat=3]. 
#### MATLAB
This package installs the MATLAB 2016b Runtime Compiler that comes with the TIMESAT package.  It does not install it as a dependency.  Uninstallation will not remove the MRC.
