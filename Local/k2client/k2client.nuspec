### Note
This package is useless by itself.  It requires a [Sassafras K2 "KeyServer"](https://www.sassafras.com/) back-end which is a licensed enterprise product.  This package is just a way to have a pain-free initial installation of the latest client version.  Once installed, the K2client ("KeyAccess") can be updated by its server.  

You will want to identify the KeyServer using a `/Host` parameter argument for example:

`choco install k2client --params '"/Host:k2.example.com"'`

You may also want to identify the server where the installer for K2client is hosted and can be downloaded.  Your local K2 server can provide the download, so if you don't supply a `/Source` package parameter, the `/Host` server will be used (with the default, "/site" folder added).  As such, the example above is equivilent to:

`choco install k2client --params '"/Host:k2.example.com /Source:k2.example.com/site"'`

If the `/Source` parameter is simply "Sassafras", the download will come directly from Sassafras.  Any other `/Source` must include the full URL without the "https://" protocol.

Examples:
`choco install k2client --params '"/Host:k2.example.com /Source:Sassafras"'`
`choco install k2client --params '"/Host:k2.example.com /Source:myserver.com/downloads"'`

If you are using a local Source, then you control the version and don't need to confirm the checksum.  In that case, you probably will want to use the `--ignorechecksums` switch.
