    <summary>Software used for X-ray Crystallography</summary>
    <description>This is the software package distributed by Bruker with X-ray Crystallography equipment.  It is widely used in the Chemistry department.  The release notes were produced May 24, 2000 and include the following requirements:

* Windows NT version 4.0 or Windows 2000, service pack 1 or later.
* Intel-compatible CPU.
* 64 Mbytes memory recommended.
* Display mode of 256 colors. Higher color modes are not fully supported. Lower color modes are not supported at all.
* The highest resolution screen mode supported is 1200x1600.

The installer is 16-bit, so the only way to install it is by manually manipulating file locations and adjusting system variables.

The licensing is completely unclear.  Bruker only provided (provides?) it with the XRC equipment, and it is not downloadable.  Nobody has ever produced a license or information on where it can be used.
