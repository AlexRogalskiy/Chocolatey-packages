    <summary>Design, document and communicate your ideas in 3D.</summary>
    <description>SketchUp is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications.

Whoever asked for complicated CAD software? SketchUp is hands-down the most intuitive and easy-to-learn 3D drawing tool around.  SketchUp isn’t just for 3D models though. Draw plans, elevations, details, title blocks and a lot more with LayOut. SketchUp is accurate to a thousandth of an inch, so you can design, specify, and plan with as much or little detail as you need. 

* Create 3D models of buildings, furniture, interiors, landscapes, and more.
* Customize the SketchUp interface to reflect the way you work.
* Share 3D models as walkthrough animations, scenes, or printouts, with realistic light and shadows. You can even print a model on a 3D printer.
* Import files from other 3D modeling programs or tools, or export your SketchUp file for use with other popular modeling and image-editing software.

#### [Hardware requirement](https://help.sketchup.com/en/sketchup/sketchup-hardware-and-software-requirements)
SketchUp v2017 no longer has software rendering of models.  It requires a 3D class video card with 1GB of memory or higher and hardware acceleration. Please ensure that the video card driver supports OpenGL version 3.0 or higher and is [up to date](https://help.sketchup.com/article/36254).

"*SketchUp's performance relies heavily on the graphics card driver and its ability to support OpenGL 3.0 or higher. To test your graphics card's compatibility, please download and run the [SketchUp 2017 Checkup application](http://help.sketchup.com/en/sucheck). Historically, people have seen problems with Intel-based cards with SketchUp. We don't recommend using these graphics cards with SketchUp at this time.*"

This package makes no attempt to confirm that this hardware requirement is met.

#### Trial/Freeware (limited functionality)
This package loads the Sketchup Pro installer which functions as follows:
* &lt;=30 days: All SketchUp Pro features on a trial basis
* &gt;30 days: On first run, user (admin) must make a choice:
    * SketchUp Pro features expire and software becomes SketchUp Make -- a limited, non-commercial [freeware](http://help.sketchup.com/en/content/sketchup-make-and-sketchup-pro) version.
    * [Buy a Pro license](http://www.sketchup.com/buy/sketchup-pro). 
    
##### Freeware Licensing Note
SketchUp Make software is [licensed only for non-commercial use for your internal business purposes](https://www.sketchup.com/license/c/sketchup). Non-commercial use means that **you may not sell, rent, lease or lend the output of the Software**. Any other use requires the purchase of a SketchUp Pro license.

#### Package Parameters
The following package parameters can be set to [pre-populate an authorization code](https://help.sketchup.com/en/article/3000285). (Users will still have to authorize the software with a couple clicks.):

* `/ActivationFile:`_&lt;path&gt;_ -- (Filepath or URL) to copy a remote ["Activation Info file"](https://help.sketchup.com/en/article/3000285). 
* `/SN:`_&lt;Your serial number&gt;_ -- To create the activation file.  Use with `/AuthCode`.
* `/AuthCode:`_&lt;Your authorization code&gt;_ -- To create the activation file.  Use with `/SN`.

By default, this package will uninstall a 2016 version of SketchUp (if found).  If you want to have both versions installed at the same time (keeping the 2016 version), use a `/Keep` parameter.  **Note:** The 2016 version will **not** be removable via Chocolatey  after using this option.

These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
Examples : 

* `-params '"/SN:RA-99999999-ALR /AuthCode:ab3de21fgh /Keep"'`.
* `-params '"/ActivationFile:http://localsite.org/activation_info.txt"'`.
    _(note: File paths with spaces require double-double quotes around the path)_
