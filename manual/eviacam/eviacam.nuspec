#### Useful note
[Precision Gaze Mouse](https://precisiongazemouse.org/) is a one-click, FOSS application which provides and interesting approach for hands-free computer control. You can combine its eye-tracking technology with eViacam's face-tracking to get the best of both worlds: the speed of gaze tracking, and the precision of head tracking. You can instantly move the mouse pointer by just looking to the desired position and then use the movements of your head to reach the right spot with precision. [This page](https://precisiongazemouse.org/manual/#eviacam-instructions) describes how to set up it with eViacam.
