The [Precision Gaze Mouse package](https://www.chocolatey.org/packages/gazemouse) can enhance your hands-free computer control. It combines eye-tracking technology with eViacam's face-tracking ability to offer the best of both worlds: the speed of gaze tracking, and the precision of head tracking. You can instantly move the mouse pointer by just looking to the desired position and then use the movements of your head to reach the right spot with precision.
