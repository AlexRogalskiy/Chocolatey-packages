    <summary>A stateless password management solution.</summary>
    <description>Master Password is a completely new way of thinking about passwords.

It consists of an algorithm that implements the core idea and applications for various platforms making the alogirthm available to users on a variety of devices and platforms.

### The Master Password way

* Stop writing down your passwords.
* Stop storing your passwords in a "secure" place, such as a vault, a keychain, an app or "the cloud".
* In fact, just stop thinking about passwords at all.

Master Password users have no more passwords. They have a password. Their password is their single master key for unlocking all doors.

#### One, two, enter.

As a Master Password user, there are about three steps to entering any site:

1. Enter your master password to unlock your Master Password app.
2. Find the name of the site you want to get into, copy its key.
3. Paste the site's key into the site and log in.

Most browsers will then ask you to "save" the site's password. For most people, this is a good idea and will subsequently allow you to log in without having to use Master Password at all.
