    <description>Mercury offers a comprehensive range of tools for 3D structure visualization and the exploration of crystal packing. With a long pedigree and over 10,000 downloads, Mercury is firmly established as the visualiser of choice within the crystallographic community.

With a vast number of options for customizing display settings Mercury is widely used for the generation of publication-quality images. A Style Manager contains a number of pre-defined display styles for work, publication and presentation and also provides the ability to preserve and share your own custom display settings. Stunning 3D images created using Mercury can be exported in a variety of common formats. In addition, it is possible to render high quality ray-traced images using POV-Ray.

Mercury is able to load structural data from a variety of formats and provides an extensive array of options to aid the investigation and analysis of crystal structures. Generate packing diagrams of any number of unit cells in any direction, define and visualise least-squares and Miller planes, and take a slice through a crystal in any direction. Simulated diffraction patterns can be calculated for any displayed crystal structure. Bravais, Friedel, Donnay and Harker (BFDH) theoretical crystal morphologies can also be viewed.

A unique and key feature of Mercury is the ability to locate and display hydrogen bonds, short non-bonded contacts, and user-specified types of contacts e.g. chlorine...oxygen contacts in the range 2-4Å. By building and exploring networks of intermolecular contacts you will gain an understanding of the key interactions that drive crystal packing.

Mercury is available as a free download. The version of Mercury provided to CSD System subscribers contains some extra functionality, only available to those with a CSD System licence. If your institution has one of these, you may obtain this functionality by registration

# License Agreement

_In order to download this version of Mercury, you must first read and accept the terms of the following licence agreement:_

Mercury (the "Program") is a copyright work of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre ("CCDC") and its licensors. In consideration of the access to the Program granted you, you agree to download and use the Program solely in accordance with the following terms. If the Program is supplied to you under a licence with CCDC Software Ltd or under a licence of access agreement to the Cambridge Structural Database System with the CCDC, the terms of that licence shall prevail. Otherwise the terms below shall apply.

You are permitted to download and to use a single copy of the Program and the documentation solely for internal research, development or teaching purposes and for no other purpose whatsoever. Results generated using the Program may be published, provided all such publications include an acknowledgement of the Program.

    <releaseNotes>[Last updated 01 March 2016]

### Major new features
    New CSD-Community menu providing access to CSD Deposit and Access
    Structures services online as well as the CSD Teaching Database, 
    enCIFer and CellCheckCSD.
    
    New CSD-System menu providing access to searching in WebCSD and ConQuest
    as well as integration of geometry analysis using Mogul and interaction
    analysis using IsoStar.

    CSD-Discovery menu extended to provide direct access to protein-ligand
    docking using GOLD, analysis of protein-ligand interactions and flexible
    overlay for multiple ligands.
    
    CSD-Materials menu extended to provide direct access to solution of crystal
    structures from powder diffraction data using DASH.

### Changes - General
    POV-Ray output now correctly honours the size, orientation, location,
    colour and font of labels from Mercury
