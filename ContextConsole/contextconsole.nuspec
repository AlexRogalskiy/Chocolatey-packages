    <description>The ContextConsole Shell Extension adds an "Open Command Prompt" menu item to the context menus (right-click menus) in Windows Explorer so that you can open a command prompt in the selected directory (or directories) or in the current directory that you are viewing.

### Features
* Open a command prompt in the current directory and in multiple directories at once.

  You can open a command prompt in the directory that you are currently in by right-clicking on any empty screen space in the directory. This eliminates the need to navigate up a level in order to open a command prompt in the current directory, which was one of the biggest shortcomings of [Microsoft's Open Command Window Here PowerToy](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx).

  You can also open multiple command prompts by selecting a group of directories and invoking the command prompt.

* Support for elevated command prompts

  On versions of Windows that have UAC (Windows Vista, Windows 7, etc.), the ContextConsole Shell Extension can be used to open elevated command prompts.

* Tiny footprint

  Compared to similar shell extensions, the ContextConsole Shell Extension has an extremely small memory and disk footprint (the 32-bit version consumes less than 16 KiB of disk space).

* Free and open-source

  The ContextConsole Shell Extension is open-source, licensed under a [BSD-style license](http://code.kliu.org/cmdopen/license.txt), so that anyone with some knowledge of C can easily build their own customized version of this shell extension.
  
* Compatibility: international support and 64-bit-compatible
  
  The user interface text has been translated into [many languages](http://code.kliu.org/cmdopen/#translations), so that it will blend in seamlessly with most systems. Additionally, this shell extension is natively Unicode and can thus support a wide range of directory names.

  Both x86-32 and x86-64 systems are natively supported, so you can use this with the increasingly common 64-bit versions of Windows.
  
* Support for network paths

  You can even open directories from [network paths](http://code.kliu.org/cmdopen/screenshots/network_prompt.png) (UNC paths).
